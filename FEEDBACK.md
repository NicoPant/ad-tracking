# ‚úÖ Pros

* Use of a `Makefile` for automation
* Docker Compose setup provided
* Dockerfile

# ‚ùå Cons

* Singleton usage for `MongoClient` (could lead to issues in concurrent scenarios)
* No unit tests included
* No bench performance tests
* Use of `vendor` directory alongside `go.mod` (redundant and discouraged)
* No use of dragonfly

# üìù Conclusion

* The use of the `vendor` directory is generally deprecated in modern Go projects using modules (`go.mod`). It‚Äôs better to rely solely on module-based dependency management unless there's a specific requirement.
* While the `Makefile` includes a command for running Docker Compose, it would be helpful to also include targets for building the Go binary or running tests to improve developer experience.
